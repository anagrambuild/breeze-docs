# What is Breeze API?

Breeze API provides a simple and fast way to integrate Breeze's risk-managed yield functionality into your application, offering the same familiar 
experience as traditional web2 APIs. With straightforward https endpoints and JSON responses, you can completely integrate Breeze into your existing 
app without requiring significant code rewrites or blockchain expertise from your development team. The API abstracts away the complexity of Solana 
blockchain interactions, allowing you to focus on building your user experience while leveraging Breeze's sophisticated risk management and yield 
optimization features.
