## Getting to the Strategy Creation

There are two ways to start creating a strategy:

## Creating Your Strategy

    <Note>
      **What do these assets mean?**

      The assets you select here determine which tokens your users will be able to deposit into your strategy to earn yield. For example, if you select USDC and SOL, your users can deposit either of these tokens and earn yield on their deposits.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Fee Distribution">
    Configure the fee percentage for your strategy.

    <Warning>
      **How fees work:**

      The fee you set is taken **only from the yield earned by your users**, not from their deposits.

      For example, if you set a 10% fee and your user earns 100 USD in yield, you will receive 10 USD as your fee. The user keeps 90 USD of their earned yield, and their original deposit remains untouched.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and Create">
    Review all your strategy settings to make sure everything is configured correctly, then click the **Create** button.

    <Tip>
      Strategy creation may take a some time as it requires creating various on-chain accounts. Please be patient while the strategy creation is being executed.
