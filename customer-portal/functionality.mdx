Each strategy has its own detailed view with three tabs: **Overview**, **Allocations**, and **Fee Info**.

**Active Yield Allocations** breaks down positions by asset with expandable details showing protocol, value, APY, and allocation percentage.

### Strategy Details - Fee Info Tab

The Fee Info tab displays your **Performance Fee** percentage, **Fee Recipient** wallet address, and **Distribution Frequency**.

<Note>
