# Breeze UI

**Breeze-UI** is an open-source UI framework for building flexible, composable interfaces tailored for DeFi aggregator protocols. Instead of relying on precompiled packages with limited customizability, you get actual component source code-designed for protocol-level control and deep integration.

<Note>
This is not just a component library. It's a development workflow for creating your own DeFi UI layer with components that you fully own.

## Core Principles

  <Card title="Open Code" icon="code">
    You receive the full component source code. Modify logic, structure, or styling freely without wrapping or overriding.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Composable Interface" icon="puzzle-piece">
    All components follow a consistent API. Whether you're building a swap interface or a yield dashboard, components are predictable and interoperable.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Protocol-Aware Distribution" icon="download">
    CLI tools and flat schemas make it easy to install, share, and maintain DeFi-specific components across projects.

    Pre-styled with accessible, minimal, and financial-grade UX patterns. Ready to ship or customize.

  <Card title="AI-Ready" icon="brain">
    Components are structured so that LLMs can read, understand, and assist with customization, documentation, and generation.

## Why Not Use Traditional Libraries?

<Accordion title="The Problem with Traditional UI Libraries">
Most UI libraries work well until you need something specific to DeFi-like integrating wallet modals, real-time token routing, or gas fee awareness. Traditional libraries force workarounds that slow down development and create inconsistent UX.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How Breeze-UI Solves This">
**breeze-ui** solves this by giving you full control from day one. Whether you're building a DEX aggregator, a yield optimizer, or a lending dashboard, **breeze-ui** gives you the foundation to move fast, stay consistent, and scale with confidence-all while keeping full ownership of your UI stack.

<Info>
**Perfect for**: DEX aggregators, yield optimizers, lending dashboards, and any DeFi protocol requiring custom UI components with full control and ownership.
