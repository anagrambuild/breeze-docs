    Breeze is designed with developers in mind, offering plug-and-play <strong>integration that takes minutes, not months.</strong> Whether you are building a trading platform, Telegram bot, mobile app, or any financial product, <strong>Breeze’s SDK</strong> and comprehensive <strong>API</strong> documentation make integration effortless. With just a few lines of code, you can embed sophisticated DeFi yield strategies and risk management directly into your existing infrastructure. No complex setup, no lengthy onboarding – just clean, developer-friendly tools that scale with your platform’s needs. And if you don’t want to change your React Code, the <strong>Breeze UI Library</strong> lets you drop in fully functional components without touching the SDK or API – perfect for rapid prototyping or production-ready apps.

# **Possible Integration Methods**
## **1. Breeze API**

Breeze API gives you full programmatic access to your users' data and fund activity, making it easy to integrate Breeze into any platform – backend, frontend, mobile, or bots. With a wide range of endpoints, you can fetch user information, build custom transactions and deposit instructions, track portfolio value, and more. It’s the core of Breeze’s flexibility, giving you everything you need to power DeFi features in your own product.

## **2. Breeze SDK**

Breeze SDK is a TypeScript-first toolkit designed to make integration with the Breeze API seamless and developer-friendly. Ideal for Telegram bots, web apps, and any financial tools built in JavaScript or TypeScript, the SDK abstracts away direct API calls and provides a clean, intuitive interface for accessing user data, creating transactions, and managing funds – all with minimal setup and maximum flexibility.

## **3. Breeze UI Library**

Breeze UI Library is a plug-and-play React component library that lets you add Breeze functionality to your app without writing any custom logic. It includes prebuilt components like deposit/withdraw buttons, user stats, and fund views — all fully connected to the Breeze API and SDK. No need to handle integration or state management yourself — just drop in the components and go.
