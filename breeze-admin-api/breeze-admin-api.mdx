# What is Breeze Admin API?

The Breeze Admin API provides administrative access to manage and configure your Breeze integration. This privileged API allows you to create funds, manage user accounts, generate API keys, and monitor system-wide statistics. Designed for backend systems and administrative dashboards, the Admin API gives you complete control over your Breeze deployment while maintaining security through API key authentication.

Unlike the standard Breeze API which focuses on user transactions and portfolio management, the Admin API handles foundational setup tasks, user provisioning, and system monitoring that are essential for platform operators and integrators.

# Admin API Methods Overview

## Fund Management
- **`GET /create_fund`** - Create a new Breeze fund for your platform. Returns the fund key and transaction signature for the newly created fund.
- **`GET /create_record`** - Record current state and value of all funds at a specific timestamp. Essential for maintaining historical snapshots and audit trails.

## User & API Key Management
- **`GET /create_api_admin`** - Generate a new admin API user with elevated privileges. Returns the admin user ID and corresponding API key for administrative access.
- **`POST /create_api_user`** - Create a new standard API user account. Requires user_id in the request body and returns the user's API key for standard Breeze API access.
- **`GET /increase_credit/{user_id}`** - Increase the API credit limit for a specific user. Returns updated user information including total credits and consumption details.

## User Fund Account Setup
- **`POST /create_user_fund/ix`** - Generate Solana instructions for creating a user fund account. Use this when you need granular control over transaction construction.
- **`POST /create_user_fund/tx`** - Generate a complete, serialized transaction for user fund account creation. Simpler option for standard implementations.
