The Breeze SDK is a comprehensive TypeScript library that provides developers with a clean, type-safe interface for interacting with the Breeze fund 
management API, enabling seamless integration of Solana-based financial operations including fund creation, user management, deposit and withdrawal 
transactions, and real-time portfolio tracking. Built with modern development practices, the SDK features robust error handling with custom 
BreezeApiError types, flexible transaction parameter options, timeout management, and both high-level convenience methods through the main BreezeSDK 
class and low-level API access for advanced users, making it easy for developers to build applications that manage investment funds, process user
transactions, retrieve fund analytics, and generate Solana transaction instructions without dealing with the complexity of direct API calls.
